        <p>Iroh was a retired Fire Nation Genral.He earned the nickname,"Dragon of the West", after claiming to "slay" the last dragon.Iroh admired all four elements.He was known to incorparate other bending techniques with his fire bending.With his knowledge of other elements, He would provide advice to others.He also assited many friends and associates.It was claimed that he journeyed to the Spirit World in search of his deceased son Lu Ten, He was killed during his father's famous six-hundred-day Siege of Ba Sing Se.</p>

        <p>Like his father before him, Iroh was a renowned Fire Nation General during the Hundred Year War.Iroh enjoyed serving as a military commander and fully embraced his role as heir to the Fire Lord. He later mused that his blood "boiled with desire" for power at the time.His views at the time partially stemmed from a desire to honor his father Azulon and grandfather Sozin, both of which had fully committed themselves to the war.Acting on a vision he had witnessed in his youth which told him he would capture the Earth Kingdom capital of Ba Sing Se, Iroh besieged the great city for six hundred days, and successfully breached the Outer Wall. However, before he could breach the Inner Wall, his son Lu Ten was killed on the front lines, and in his grief, Iroh lost most of his fighting spirit and abandoned the siege.The Siege of Ba Sing Se came to be seen as a terrible dishonor and failure for Iroh. <a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Iroh">Source</a>

          <p>After the traumatic death of his son, Iroh saw Zuko as his own son rather than his nephew, and encouraged him to choose his own destiny.Around 97 AG, an indulgent Iroh allowed his beloved nephew to observe a meeting of Fire Lord Ozai's war council under the promise that he would not speak.However, Zuko did speak up, and even though Iroh silently agreed with him, the Fire Lord demanded that Zuko participate in an<a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Agni_Kai"> Agni Kai</a> for his insubordination.Iroh witnessed how Zuko refused to duel his father, though averted his gaze when Ozai proceeded to burn Zuko's face, scarring him. Iroh subsequently accompanied Zuko on his quest to find the Avatar, and it was through Iroh's influence that Zuko was able to procure a ship and a crew.</p>

          <p>Genral Iroh was part of a secret organization known as, The White Lotus.He was ranked as a Grand Master, the highest achivable status. The White Lotus trancends the nations and war, and includes masters from all nations. The White Lotus is founded on bringing balance and peace to the world. The organization made sure Iroh and Zuko made it safley to Ba Sing Se as refugees. Later, they helped Ba Sing Se liberate themselves from the Fire Nation.</p>

          <p> Iroh spent his days after the end of the Hundred Year War running the Jasmine Dragon(his own tea shop) and perspicaciously playing Pai Sho.Sometime after 131 AG, feeling that he had done all he could in the material world, Iroh chose to ascend to the Spirit World, leaving his mortal body behind and letting his soul make a new home there, where he made friends with many spirits, and also constructed a new tea shop. Iroh was easygoing, open-minded, wise, comforting, generous, advising, kind, and humorous.However, beneath his easygoing attitude lays a wise man experienced in the ways of the world, a seasoned and wily strategist, and an incredibly strong and powerful firebending master.
